# Paths of Memory: A Sephardi Migration Story Map
This repository documents Sephardi migration paths using an interactive Leaflet story map.
The map integrates a linked Google Sheets template and scrolling narrative to visualize locations, movements, and community histories.
It supports embedded images, audio, and video, along with Leaflet TileLayer and GeoJSON overlays to enhance geographic and cultural context.

## Create Your Own Migration Path and Send Us the Link to Upload Into the World Sephardic Database
- See step-by-step tutorial in *Hands-On Data Visualization* https://HandsOnDataViz.org/leaflet-storymaps-with-google-sheets.html
- When done, send us the link to shaicohen@miami.edu. 

#### Geocode your address data with Google Sheets add-on
To geocode (find latitude and longitude coordinates), we recommend installing the free [Geocoding by SmartMonkey add-on for Google Sheets](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/geocoding_by_smartmonkey/1033231575312). Insert your addresses in place of the samples in the Geocoding Details tab, then use Add-Ons > Geocoding > Geocode Details menu. Learn more in *Hands-On Data Visualization* https://handsondataviz.org/geocode.html

#### To finalize your map, you need to either:
- Download each Google Sheets tab as a CSV file and upload into a `csv` subfolder in your GitHub repo
  - OR
- Get your own Google Sheets API Key to insert into `google-doc-url.js`
